    <!-- About -->
    <p>Welcome to my encryption and decryption learning project that I built as a part of Oregon State University's CS 361 class. This class delves into software engineering and project management, and my project is a hands-on application of these disciplines. I, Abigail Whittle, have personally developed this project, incorporating Damiant Chauhan's Lorem Ipsum API. This API generates random filler text, which is then used as sample data for encryption, providing a clear visual representation of how different encryption schemes modify text. The use of this API was crucial in my understanding microservices and their role in larger-scale projects.</p>

    <p>If you're curious about the technical details or want to delve into the code, you can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/awhittle2/CS361-project">GitHub</a></p>

    <p>This project is designed to educate users about various encryption schemes, such as Base64, Binary, Rail Fence, and Vigenere. It offers an in-depth understanding of what encryption is and its critical role in maintaining digital security. Whether you're a newcomer to encryption or looking to expand your knowledge, this project is crafted to be an informative and accessible resource for everyone.</p>

    <p>To begin exploring, you can navigate to the two buttons at the bottom of the page labeled "Encryption" and "Decryption". If you are just starting and unfamiliar with these concepts, I recommend beginning with the "Encryption" section, as it lays the foundation for understanding the decryption process. And remember, you can always return to this homepage by clicking "Home" at the top left corner of the webpage.</p>

    <p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
